# Task 3: Multi-Table Operations & Joins (PostgreSQL)

## Objective
This task focuses on mastering SQL joins and multi-table operations using a relational
employees database. The goal is to understand how tables relate to each other and how
to extract meaningful business insights using joins, unions, subqueries, and aggregation.

## Dataset Overview
Tables used:
- employees: Employee master data
- departments: Department list
- dept_emp: Employee–department mapping
- dept_manager: Department managers
- salaries: Salary history
- titles: Job title history

## Key Concepts Covered
- INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN
- UNION and UNION ALL
- Correlated subqueries
- DISTINCT filtering
- Conditional aggregation
- Handling NULL values
- Referential integrity using foreign keys

## Exercises Implemented
1. Employee–Department Mapping (INNER JOIN)
2. Employee–Manager Relationship (LEFT JOIN)
3. Active vs Former Employees (UNION)
4. Current Salary Retrieval (Subquery)
5. Unique Job Titles (DISTINCT)
6. Department-wise Gender Ratio (Aggregation)

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin
- GitHub

## Outcome
Successfully generated multi-table analytical reports with accurate joins and
validated relational integrity across tables.
